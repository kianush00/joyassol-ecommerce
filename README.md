## Getting started

To set up the Joyas Sol Ecommerce Application, follow these steps:

### 1. Install pnpm Dependencies

First, install the required npm dependencies by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pnpm install
```

This will download all the necessary packages listed in package.json.

## 2. Create a New Sanity Project

Set up a Sanity project to manage your ecommerce content:

```bash
pnpm create sanity@latest -- --env=.env.local --create-project "Joyassol ecommerce" --dataset production
```

If you don’t have a Sanity account, this command will guide you to create one.
When prompted with "Would you like to add configuration files for a Sanity project in this Next.js folder?", select "n" (no), as the --env=.env.local flag handles this automatically.
After running this command, a .env.local file will be created (or updated) in your project root with:
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID: A unique ID for your Sanity project, generated during this step.
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET: Set to production.

- Note: You can verify your NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID later by logging into https://www.sanity.io/manage, selecting the "Joyassol ecommerce" project, and checking the project details.

## 3. Set Up Environment Variables

The application requires additional environment variables beyond those set in Step 2. Edit your .env file in the project root to include the following:

```bash

NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=<already-set-by-step-2>
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET="production"
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/signin
SANITY_API_TOKEN=<your-sanity-api-token>
SANITY_API_READ_TOKEN=<your-sanity-api-read-token>
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=<your-clerk-publishable-key>
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=<your-clerk-secret-key>
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=<your-stripe-secret-key>
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_KEY=<your-stripe-webhook-key>

```

### Where to Find These Credentials

#### Sanity Variables:

SANITY_API_TOKEN and SANITY_API_READ_TOKEN:
Visit https://www.sanity.io/manage.
Select your "Joyassol ecommerce" project.
Go to the "API" section.
Click "Add API token" and create tokens with the appropriate permissions (e.g., "Editor" for write, "Viewer" for read).
Copy the tokens into .env.local.

#### Clerk Variables:

NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY and CLERK_SECRET_KEY: Sign up at https://clerk.dev, create an application, and find these keys in your Clerk dashboard.

#### Stripe Variables:

STRIPE_SECRET_KEY and STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET: Register at https://stripe.com, create an account, and retrieve these from your Stripe dashboard.

#### Additional Notes:

NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL: Set to http://localhost:3000 for local development. Update to your live domain (e.g., https://joyassol.cl/) when deploying.
Do not commit .env.local to version control, as it contains sensitive data. Next.js automatically excludes it via .gitignore.

## 4. Optionally Import Demo Seed Data

To populate your Sanity project with sample data (e.g., products or blog posts), run:

```bash
npx sanity@latest dataset import seed.tar.gz
```

This step is optional and requires a seed.tar.gz file, which may be included with the template.

## 5. Run the Development Server

Launch the Next.js development server with:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

## 6. Access the Application

- Visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see the ecommerce website.
- Go to http://localhost:3000/admin/studio to access the Sanity Studio and manage your content.

## Customizing

To tailor the template to your needs:

- Modify files in the /app and /components directories.
- Changes will reflect instantly due to Next.js’s hot reloading feature.
